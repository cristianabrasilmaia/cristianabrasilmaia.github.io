# Cristiana Brasil Maia

## [Versão em português](/index.md)

I am a Mechanical Engineering (1997) from Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) and received the Agnelo Macedo (Gold Medal) award for First Classification in the Course. In 2000, I received a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from UFMG, in *Heat and Fluids* area, with the title: Development of a Numerical Methodology for the Analysis of Solar Chimneys: Study of the Influence of Geometric Parameters. In 2005, I received a doctor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from UFMG, in *Heat and Fluids* area, with the title Theoretical and Experimental Analysis of a Solar Chimney: Thermofluidodynamic Evaluation. In 2001, I started my teaching career at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais (*PUC Minas*). From 2005 to 2007, I also taught at *Fundação Universidade de Itaúna*. In 2008, I started teaching in the Post-Graduate Program in Mechanical Engineering (PPGEM) of PUC Minas. In 2012, I became a member of the PPGEM Collegiate and, since August 2016, I took over the coordination of the course. I have a CNPq Research Productivity Scholarshio, Level 2, since 2016.

## Areas of interest
Mechanical Engineering, with emphasis on thermal and fluid systems. My current research lines are solar energy, solar chimney, solar drying, desalination, wind tunnel, fluid structure interaction (FSI) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
